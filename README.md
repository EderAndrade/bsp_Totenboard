Hello everyone.

This is Eder.

I made this BSP (Board Support Package) to use with Totenboard, the same board I released in this profile. But, don't worry
if you don't have this one, you can use the package with Discovery to make your own projects.

This package has the following features:

Support to:
- LCD alphanumeric
- Bluetooth 
- USB
- ADC
- LEDs of Discovery
- User button

Soon I'll release another version with ESP8266 support.

I hope you enjou ;)
